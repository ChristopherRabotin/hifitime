All time zones are defined with respect to UTC. Moreover, Utc inherently supports the past leap seconds, as reported by the IETF and NIST at https://www.ietf.org/timezones/data/leap-seconds.list . NOTE: leap seconds cannot be predicted! This module will be updated as soon as possible after a new leap second has been announced. WARNING: The historical oddities with calendars are not yet supported. Moreover, despite the fields of Utc being public, it is strongly advised to use the `new` function to ensure proper bound checking and correct leap second support. If your code breaks because you're not using `new`, don't file a bug."]]});
